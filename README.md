# Wellcome Genome Campus Advanced Courses and Scientific Conferences

WordPress website for Wellcome Genome Advanced Courses and Scientific Conferences.

Utilises the [Foundation 6 Wordpress Template](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/), and the [Fewbricks Wordpress Plugin](https://github.com/folbert/fewbricks) to store ACF configuration in code.

## Site URLs

* Live: https:// ??? .wellcomegenomecampus.org/
* Sanger Staging: http://wt- ??? .sandbox.sanger.ac.uk/
* S24 Staging: http://wgcacsc.s24.net/
* Development: http://wgacsc.dev

## Building the site

To build the site once:

    cd web/wp-content/themes/wgcacsc
    npm run build

And to continuously watch the project for changes run:

    cd web/wp-content/themes/wgcacsc
    npm run watch

## Hosting

The Studio24 staging site is hosted on: ?? new server ??, the Sanger web team host a live and staging site (which are listed above).

## Deployment

### Deploy the site to Sanger live/staging:

To deploy the site live, simply merge any changes into the master branch and send an email to web@sanger.ac.uk requesting that a deployment be made on the Sanger server.

If database changes need to be made, then these can be made on the Sanger staging site (http://wt- ??? .sandbox.sanger.ac.uk/) using the sdunwoody login stored in Bitbucket (we need to get this changed to a Studio24 username, but this hasn't been actioned yet). If database changes are made to the Sanger staging site, you will also need to notify the web team that these changes need pulling in with your deploy.

### Deploy the site to Studio24 staging:

This is currently just a git pull on the server.

```
#!bash
ssh studio24@goldeneye.studio24.net
su root
cd /var/www/wgcc/wascc/staging/
git pull
## This part might not be needed
cd ..
chown -R apache:apache wgccc.s24.net
```

## Documentation
